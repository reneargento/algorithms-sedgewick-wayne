# Algorithms
Solutions to the exercises of the Algorithms book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (4th editon).

I found the book to be an excellent resource to learning algorithms and data structures. Since there are not many (almost none) solutions of the exercises on the Internet and the only ones I've found are either incomplete or require a payment to be accessed, I  decided to share my work on the exercises so far. Hopefully that will help students and professionals to validate their exercise solutions and learn more about the book content.

There may be mistakes, but to the best of my knowledge, these solutions are correct.

Many of these exercises are used as homework assignments in universities. If you have to do any of these exercises as homework make sure you understand the problem and solution instead of simply copying it. Understanding these algorithms and data structures will be extremelly valuable in your career.

This is a work in progress. I am updating this repository as I finish the exercises.
