With an algorithm that takes as input N distinct points in the plane and can return the number of triples that
fall on the same line it is possible to solve the 3-SUM problem in the following way:

For each number x in the list of numbers, create the point (x, x^3) (for now we assume that the elements are distinct).
Then, check whether there exists three collinear points from among the created points.

To see that this works, note that if x + y + z = 0 then the slope of the line from x to y is:
(y^3 - x^3) / (y - x) = y^2 + yx + x^2

And the slope of the line from x to z is
(z^3 - x^3) / (z - x) = z^2 + zx + x^2

Replacing z with (- x - y) in the equation above:
(-(x + y))^2 - (x + y)x + x^2
x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - x^2 - xy + x^2
y^2 + yx + x^2

Conversely, if the slope from x to y equals the slope from x to z (since collinear points have the same slope
among themselves), then:
y^2 + yx + x^2 = z^2 + zx + x^2,
which implies that
(y - z) (x + y + z) = 0,
so either y = z or z = - x - y which suffices to prove that the reduction is valid.

If there are duplicates in the list of numbers, first check whether x + 2y = 0 for any x and duplicate element y
(in linear time using hashing or O(n lg n) time using sorting), and then remove the duplicates before reducing
to the collinear point-finding problem.
