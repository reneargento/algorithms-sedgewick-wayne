2.2.29 - Natural mergesort

Experiments:
Number of passes needed for an array of 1000 random Long keys: 8.08
Number of passes needed for an array of 10000 random Long keys: 12.00
Number of passes needed for an array of 100000 random Long keys: 15.00
Number of passes needed for an array of 1000000 random Long keys: 18.00

According to the experiments:
It is possible to see in the experiment results that the number of passes is approximately the floor of lg(N).
This makes sense since on every pass natural mergesort merges all pairs of unsorted sub-arrays.
In the worst case there are N / 2 unsorted sub-array pairs on the first pass, then N / 4 pairs on the next pass, and so on, leading to lg(N) passes.

With these results we can estimate that:
For 10^9 random Long keys approximately floor(lg(10^9)) = 29 passes are needed.
